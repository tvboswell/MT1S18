//
//2 - Write a C program to compute the equivalent resistance of the 3 parallel resistors R1, R2, R3.
//
//The equivalent resistor for 3 parallel resistors is found using the formula(The Req reciprocal = sum of all resistor reciprocals)                       1 / Req = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3
//
//Note the computed Req will always be of a value less than each of R1, R2, R3 • User should be prompted to enter values of 3 resistors(display message for input) • Code should display the output message as : The equivalent resistor of 3 parallel resistors R1(show value entered), R2(show value entered), R3(show value entered) is Req(show computed value)
//
//Code should ensure values of Resistors are non negative and entered as float numbers.Example : If user enter 5.2, 3.6, 10.9, output is The equivalent resistor of 3 parallel resistors 5.2, 3.6, 10.9 is 1.779
